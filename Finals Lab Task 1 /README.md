 > This repository contains a set of SQL tasks to be performed using MySQL Workbench. The goal is to practice essential SQL operations such as database creation, table management, data manipulation, and querying. All tasks must be executed in MySQL Workbench and completed in the order specified to maintain proper structure and data relationships.

## SQL Copy of Database and Table Structures 💻📃

> This is a .sql file containing all the CREATE TABLE statements (structure only, no data). It can be used to recreate the same database schema on another MySQL server.

To export:

In MySQL Workbench:
Go to Server > Data Export > Export to Self-Contained File (.sql) and select only the structure option.
