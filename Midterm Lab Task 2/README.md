# **Midterm Lab Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Transformation using Power Query Editor**

## 🗃️ **𝕿𝖆𝖘𝖐 𝕯𝖊𝖘𝖈𝖗𝖎𝖕𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓✍**
Company X aims to extract valuable insights from the dataset **Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv**, which contains job postings from a Kaggle dataset. The focus is on answering key questions:

1. Which job roles pay the highest and least?
2. What size companies pay the best?
3. Where do job roles or job titles pay the best and least in a specific state?

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To achieve this, the dataset undergoes cleaning and transformation using **Power Query Editor** in Excel. The process includes salary extraction, role categorization, location standardization, handling missing data, and summarizing salary distributions.
